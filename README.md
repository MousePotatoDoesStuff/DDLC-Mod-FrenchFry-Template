# Doki Doki Literature Club Modding Template

A comprehensive modding template for creating Doki Doki Literature Club mods using Ren'Py. This template provides all the necessary files, configurations, and structure to create professional DDLC mods with minimal setup.

## Template Identifier

This template used to include a `MODCEN_MARK` file in the root directory to identify it as a DDMCentral Mod Template project. This helps differentiate it from other DDLC modding templates (such as the Weiss template) which may have different structures, conventions, and setup procedures. If you're following a tutorial or seeking support, mentioning that you're using the ModCen template (identifiable by the `MODCEN_MARK` file) will help others provide more accurate assistance.

This mark was replaced with `MODCEN_MARK` as this is a forked version of the DDMC template. The fork was made from Version 0.9.0.

## Mod Installation Guide (For Players)

If you've downloaded a DDLC mod built with this template and want to play it, follow these steps:

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the mod**
   - Download the mod's `.zip` file from wherever it was distributed
   - Extract the contents to a folder of your choice

2. **Get a fresh copy of DDLC**
   - Download a fresh, unmodified copy of Doki Doki Literature Club!
   - **IMPORTANT**: Do not use a copy that already has mods installed

3. **Transfer required RPA files**
   - From your fresh DDLC installation, copy these THREE files to the mod's `game` folder:
     - `audio.rpa`
     - `fonts.rpa`
     - `images.rpa`
   - **DO NOT copy `scripts.rpa`** - The mod already includes all necessary script files!

4. **Launch the mod**
   - Run the mod's `.exe` file (Windows) or appropriate executable for your platform
   - Enjoy the mod!

### Important Notes

- **Never include `scripts.rpa`**: Mods built with this template have all script files already included. Adding `scripts.rpa` from vanilla DDLC will cause conflicts and errors.
- **Use a fresh DDLC copy**: Always start with an unmodified DDLC installation to avoid file conflicts.
- **Keep RPA files separate**: These files must be transferred by you due to Team Salvato's IP guidelines - mod creators cannot distribute them.

### Troubleshooting Installation

**Mod won't launch or shows errors:**
- Verify you copied exactly three files: `audio.rpa`, `fonts.rpa`, and `images.rpa`
- Make sure you did NOT copy `scripts.rpa`
- Ensure your DDLC copy is fresh and unmodified
- Check that the files are in the correct `game` folder

**Missing assets or broken features:**
- Confirm all three RPA files were copied correctly
- Try re-extracting the mod and starting over

## Quick Start (For Developers)

### Prerequisites

- **Ren'Py SDK** (Template works with ALL versions of Ren'Py from 6.99 onwards)
- Basic knowledge of Ren'Py scripting language
- Text editor (VS Code recommended with Ren'Py Language extension)
- A fresh copy of Doki Doki Literature Club!

### Setup

1. **Download the latest release of the template**
   - Visit the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/L4w1i3t/Doki-Doki-Modding-Template/releases)
   - Download the ZIP file for the latest release
   - Extract the contents to a folder of your choice
   - Download and extract a fresh copy of Doki Doki Literature Club! (DDLC) to a separate folder
   - Transfer the following files from the DDLC folder to the template /game folder:
     - `images.rpa`
     - `fonts.rpa`
     - `audio.rpa`
   - **DO NOT copy `scripts.rpa`** - This file is NOT needed!
     - Note: These three RPA files aren't *technically* necessary to operate the template nor have a fully playable mod (you'll give yourself a headache reconfiguring everything though), but they ARE required to be separate from the template to follow the Team Salvato IP guidelines for unaffiliated mod usage (no amount of DRM can change that).
     - `scripts.rpa` is specifically excluded because all script files needed for the engine are already packed in with the template and compiled during build time. That way, users have one less file to deal with and avoid conflicts between vanilla scripts and mod scripts.
        

2. **Open with Ren'Py Launcher**
   - Launch Ren'Py
    - Note: Ren'Py 6 and 7 use Python 2.7, while Ren'Py 8 uses Python 3, meaning there is slight variation in syntax and available features. Additionally, Ren'Py 6 is as close to vanilla DDLC whereas Ren'Py 7 and 8 have more features and allow for more complex scripting.
   - Click "Projects"
   - Navigate to the template folder
   - Select the project
     - Tip: Putting the template in the same folder as the rest of your Ren'Py projects can help keep things organized, especially if you plan to create multiple mods.

3. **Configure your mod**
   - Edit `game/options.rpy` to set your mod's name, version, and settings
   - Replace placeholder content in `game/script.rpy`
   - Add your story files to `game/story/`

4. **Test your mod**
   - Click "Launch Project" in Ren'Py Launcher

## Configuration

### Basic Settings (`game/options.rpy`)

```python
# Essential settings to customize for your mod
define config.name = "Your Mod Name Here"           # Display name
define config.version = "1.0.0"                     # Version number
define build.name = "YourModName"                    # Build filename
define config.save_directory = "YourModName"        # Save folder name

# Example from the template (found in game/options.rpy):
define config.name = "Doki Doki French Fry Mod Template"
define config.version = "0.1.0"
define build.name = "DDFF-Template"
define config.save_directory = "DDFF-Template"
```

### Character Definitions

The template includes pre-configured character definitions in `game/definitions.rpy`:

```python
# Characters are already defined:
# m = Monika, s = Sayori, n = Natsuki, y = Yuri, mc = Main Character
```

### Audio Configuration

Audio files are defined in `game/definitions.rpy`. The template includes:
- Background music tracks (`audio.t1`, `audio.t2`, etc.)
- Sound effects (`audio.page_turn`, `audio.fall`, etc.)
- Main menu music setting in `game/options.rpy` (see `config.main_menu_music`)
  - Note: The main menu music is defined as `config.main_menu_music = audio.t1` by default.

## Creating Your Mod

### 1. Story Structure

Create your story files in the `game/story/` folder:

```python
# game/story/chapter1.rpy
label chapter1:
    scene bg residential_day
    show sayori 1a at t11
    s "Hello, [player]!"
    "This is how you write dialogue."
    return
```

### 2. Main Script Entry

Edit `game/script.rpy` to call your story:

```python
label start:
    # Template setup code (keep this)
    $ quick_menu = True
    # ... initialization code ...
    
    # Replace the template story call with your own
    if persistent.playthrough == 0:
        call chapter1 from _call_chapter1  # Replace "story" with your label
        # Note: The default template calls "story" which loads game/demo/story.rpy
```

### 3. Character Expressions

Use the pre-defined character poses and expressions:

```python
show sayori 1a    # Pose 1, expression a (happy)
show sayori 1b    # Pose 1, expression b (sad)
show monika 2a    # Different pose and expression
```

### 4. Backgrounds and Music

```python
scene bg club_day          # Show club room background
play music t3              # Play track 3
stop music fadeout 1.0     # Stop music with fadeout
```

## Asset Management

### Adding New Assets

1. **Images**: Place in `game/mod_assets/images/`
2. **Music**: Place in `game/mod_assets/bgm/`
3. **Sound Effects**: Place in `game/mod_assets/sfx/`
4. **Fonts**: Place in `game/mod_assets/fonts/`

### Asset Definition

Define new assets in `game/definitions.rpy`:

```python
# New background
image bg my_background = "mod_assets/images/my_bg.png"

# New music track
define audio.my_song = "mod_assets/bgm/my_song.ogg"

# New character sprite
image mychar happy = "mod_assets/images/mychar_happy.png"
```

## Addon Creation and Management

This template's selling point is its segregation between vanilla source files, mod asset files, and additional content that can be added via plug-and-play means. This allows you to create addons that can be easily integrated into the template without modifying the core files--just function calls are necessary (*1 whole extra line of code!*) Examples of addons include but are not limited to:

- **UI and menu additions**: Achievement systems, galleries, gender selection, etc.
- **Phone and social media interfaces**: Text threads, notifications, status updates, etc.
- **Jukebox and music players**: Custom music players, playlists, etc.
- **Overrides**: Physics, character behaviors, and other gameplay mechanics that can be toggled on or off.
- **"Mods within mods"**: Gameplay loops, interactive elements, sub-engines, etc.
- **Custom Python scripts**: For advanced features or integrations.

### Creating an Addon

You can either create an addon using Ren'Py language, Python, or a combination of both. It will also provide the option of JSON knowledge. The template provides a basic structure for creating addons:

1. **Create a new folder** in `game/addons/` with your addon name (e.g., `game/addons/My Addon/`)
2. **Add your addon files**:
   - Create a main script file (something like `index.rpy`)
   - Add any additional assets in `game/addons/My Addon/assets/` (I know there's a lot of nesting here, but bear with me)
3. **Create `addon.json`** in your addon folder to define metadata (OPTIONAL but recommended):

```json
{
    "name": "My Addon",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "A cool addon for my mod",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "dependencies": []
}
```

4. **Create your addon in any way you like**
    - 4.5. **Best Practice: Wrap the entirety of your addon logic in a Ren'Py label** to allow easy integration.

5. **Make a test file or test script** to ensure your addon works as expected. If you followed step 4.5, you can call your addon label from the main script:

```python
label test_my_addon:
    # Call your addon label here
    call my_addon_label
    return
```

6. **When you're satisfied, use or share it!** We here at ModCen love to see creativity and what modders can come up with.
    - If you so desire, you can submit your addon to the ModCen website for preservation and easy access by other modders. Just make sure to follow the submission guidelines.

## Development Tools

### Debug Mode

The template includes debugging tools in `game/dev.rpy`:

```python
# Enable during development (disable for release)
define config.developer = True      # Enables console and developer features
define config.autoreload = True     # Auto-reloads on file changes
```

**IMPORTANT**: When building your mod for release, set `config.developer = False` and `config.autoreload = False` in `game/dev.rpy` to disable these features. ALWAYS disable developer mode before building your mod to avoid including debug features in the final release.

### Console Commands

With developer mode enabled, press `Shift+O` to open console:

```python
# Jump to specific labels
$ renpy.call("your_label_name")

# Check variables
$ persistent.playthrough

# Modify variables
$ chapter = 2
```

### Quick Launch

Use `runcode.bat` to quickly open the project in VS Code.

## Building & Distribution

### Building Your Mod

1. **Disable Development Features**:
   - Set `config.developer = False` in `game/dev.rpy`
   - Set `config.autoreload = False` in `game/dev.rpy` (or comment out the line)

2. **Build via Ren'Py Launcher**:
   - Select your project
   - Click "Build Distributions"
   - Choose "Mod Export (All Platforms)" option, as it includes all necessary files for Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Wait for build completion
   - Congrats! Your mod is now ready for distribution.

3. **Output Location**:
   - Built files appear in project root folder
   - Distribute the `.zip` file using a file-sharing service or your preferred method.

### Build Configuration

The template includes optimized build settings in `game/options.rpy` under "Mod Export":

```python
# Files are automatically categorized for distribution
# Mod files and source code go to "mod" archive
# Excludes vanilla assets (audio.rpa, fonts.rpa, images.rpa)
# Note: scripts.rpa is never needed - all scripts are compiled into the mod
```

**Important**: Your built mod will NOT include `audio.rpa`, `fonts.rpa`, or `images.rpa`. Players must add these files themselves from a fresh DDLC installation. This is required by Team Salvato's IP guidelines. Never include `scripts.rpa` - it's not needed and will cause conflicts.

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

1. **Separate story files**: Use multiple `.rpy` files in `game/story/` to keep track of different chapters or sections
   - Example: `chapter1.rpy`, `chapter2.rpy`, etc.
2. **Consistent naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for labels and variables. You'll save future you a lot of headaches.
   - Example: `label chapter1_start` instead of `label c1`
3. **Comment your code**: Explain complex logic and story branches

### Performance

1. **Image optimization**: Compress images appropriately. Generally, PNG is best for sprites and backgrounds, while JPEG is suitable for photos.
   - Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to reduce file sizes without losing quality.
2. **Audio formats**: Use OGG for music and sound effects. It is the most quality-efficient format for Ren'Py.
3. **Preload important assets**: Use `image` statements for frequently used sprites

### Miscellaneous

1. **Use persistent data**: Store player choices or unlocks using `persistent` variables
   - Example: `persistent.special_unlock = True`
2. **Content warnings**: Include appropriate warnings for mature content

### Version Control

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Exclude cache and save files
echo "game/cache/" >> .gitignore
echo "game/saves/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.rpyc" >> .gitignore
echo "*.rpyb" >> .gitignore
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Story label not found"**
- Ensure you've created the story file and defined the label
- Check spelling and case sensitivity
- Verify the file is in the correct location

**Images not displaying**
- Check file paths and extensions
- Ensure images are properly defined in `definitions.rpy`
- Verify image dimensions and format

**Audio not playing**
- Confirm audio files are in correct format (OGG/WAV, etc.)
- Check audio definitions in `definitions.rpy`
- Verify file paths are correct

**Build errors**
- Ensure that developer mode is disabled in your build (PLEASE.)
- Check for syntax errors in `.rpy` files (these are more common than you think)
- Ensure all referenced files exist

### Performance Issues

- Reduce image file sizes
- Limit simultaneous animations
- Use `$ renpy.free_memory()` after intensive scenes
- Consider using image compression

### Compatibility

- Test on different screen resolutions
- Verify mod works with various Ren'Py versions
- Check save/load functionality
- Test skip and rollback features

## File Reference

### Key Files to Customize

| File | Purpose | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| `game/options.rpy` | Basic mod configuration | **High** |
| `game/script.rpy` | Main entry point | **High** |
| `game/story/*.rpy` | Your story content | **High** |
| `game/definitions.rpy` | Asset definitions | Medium |
| `game/gui.rpy` | UI customization | Variable |
| `game/dev.rpy` | Development tools | Low (until build) |
| `game/mod_assets/*` | Custom assets (optional) | Variable |

### Files and Folders to Leave Unchanged

- `game/screens.rpy` (unless doing advanced UI work)
- `game/transforms.rpy` (unless adding custom animations)
- `vanilla/` folder (reference materials only)
- `characters/` folder (original .chr files. Only modify if you know what you're doing or want to add new .chr files)

## Advanced Features

### Custom Minigames

Create interactive elements in your story or as standalone files to be called to:

```python
# Example: Simple choice-based minigame
label minigame:
    $ points = 0
    "Let's play a game!"
    
    menu:
        "Choice A":
            $ points += 1
        "Choice B":
            $ points += 2
    
    if points >= 2:
        "You won!"
    else:
        "GG EZ I WIN + I'M JUST BETTER"
    return
```

### Persistent Data

Save data across playthroughs:

```python
# Define persistent variables
default persistent.special_unlock = False

# Use in story
if persistent.special_unlock:
    "This ain't your first rodeo, is it?"
else:
    $ persistent.special_unlock = True
    "This is your first time playing."
```

### Multiple Endings

Implement branching storylines:

```python
# Track player choices
default ending_points = 0

# In story
menu:
    "Be kind":
        $ ending_points += 1
    "Be harsh":
        $ ending_points -= 1

# At story end
if ending_points >= 5:
    call good_ending
elif ending_points <= -5:
    call bad_ending
else:
    call neutral_ending
```

### Extracting .rpa Files

To extract `.rpa` files (Ren'Py archive files), you can use RPA Extract by iwanMods: https://iwanplays.itch.io/rpaex. Just drag a `.rpa` file onto the executable, and it will extract the contents to a folder with the same name as the `.rpa` file.

### Decompiling .rpyc Files

To decompile `.rpyc` files (compiled Ren'Py scripts), you can use unrpyc by CensoredUsername: https://github.com/CensoredUsername/unrpyc. Place .unrpyc in the same folder as your Ren'Py `/game` folder, run the project, and it will decompile the `.rpyc` files into `.rpy` files for easier editing.

- This is extremely useful for compiled projects when there are only `.rpyc` files available, as it allows you to view and edit the original script content.
